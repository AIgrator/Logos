# AGENTS.md

Notes for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Commands

- Install / sync dependencies: `uv sync` (uses `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`; Python pinned to 3.12).
- Lint: `uv run ruff check <paths>` (config in `pyproject.toml`, line-length 500).
- Entry point: `main.py`. There is no automated test suite (no pytest); changes are verified manually.

## Dependency manifests — keep in sync (DO NOT FORGET)

There are two dependency manifests, and they are **manually kept in sync**:

1. `pyproject.toml` — canonical source. `setup_windows.ps1` / `setup_ubuntu.sh` install from it via `uv sync`.
2. `requirements.txt` — legacy/manual mirror. Nothing in the setup flow reads it, so it drifts silently.

Whenever a package is added/removed/changed, update **both** files. `requirements.txt`
tracks the same set as `pyproject.toml` (plus a short section header comment).

## Abandoned screen-recognition stack

Screen understanding is done by the LLM (Computer Use / vision providers), not by an
embedded local ML model. The old torch/OCR/YOLO stack was dropped from the manifests
(commit `33babd8`). Do **not** re-add torch/torchvision/ultralytics/supervision/opencv
etc. as dependencies.

## Active project

The app runs inside a selected project directory. Startup resolves the remembered
`active_project` from `settings.json`; if it is missing or gone, the UI opens the
full-screen `HomePage` (`src/ui/navigation.py`) instead of a modal picker. In the
workspace, projects and sessions are reached through the collapsible left sidebar.
Clicking a recent session opens its project and that exact session. Per-project data
lives in `<project>/.logos/`:

- `project.json` - id, name, timestamps
- `sessions/` - one JSON file per chat session (plain `user`/`assistant` turns);
  the newest is restored at startup
- `context/` - reserved for instructions/memory
- `attachments/` - reserved for project-scoped attachments

`src/project_manager.py` owns this layout. The project root (not the Logos install
directory) is the terminal/browser `working_directory` and the root passed to
`Indexer`; `.logos` is ignored by the indexer. Do not hardcode `Indexer('.')` or
`os.getcwd()` for project-scoped paths.
